.. hint:: Debian or Ubuntu?

   These two operating systems are practically the same system. You have
   probably already chosen one of the two to work with, and there is no
   reason to reconsider.

   If you haven't chosen yet, and you want to know nothing about this,
   go ahead and pick up the latest LTS version of Ubuntu, which
   currently is 16.04 (and will continue to be so until April 2018).

   The reason I recommend Ubuntu is mostly that it is more popular and
   therefore has better support by virtual server providers. Ubuntu's
   Long Term Support versions also have five years of support instead of
   only three for Debian (though recently Debian has started to offer
   LTS support but it's kind of unofficial). On the other hand I feel
   that Ubuntu sometimes rushes a little bit too much to get the latest
   software versions in the operating system release, whereas Debian can
   be a little bit more stable; but this is just a feeling, I have no
   hard data. I use Debian, but this is a personal preference because
   sometimes I'm too much of a perfectionist (with deadlines) and I want
   things my own way.
